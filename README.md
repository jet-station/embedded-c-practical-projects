[Embedded Software Programming Concepts](https://github.com/Sigma-eLabs/embedded-software-programming-concepts) will focus on the techniques to design and development a robustness software, which is strong demanded in today by users, customers, and employers.

Having the knowledge about the programming principles, good ideas to build a stable and high-performance software is very important because of the demand of the market. Also, having an overview that why software is being designed in different ways depend on the requirement of projects, would support you design and implement a robustness software.

The topics may be simple, but I believe that it is a launchpad for you to approach the much higher complex technical topic in embedded programming world!

# Topics
Summary of the topics are already available:
| Topic    | Description |
| :-------- | :------- |
| [Board Support Packages](/Board_Support_Packages/)  | Examples of BSP implementation techniques  |

# Requisitions
The below requistions are used for demostration only. For your case, you can choose another setup and implement the idea provided in the examples.
## Hardware
Development Kit used in the most of topics is [Tiva C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad Evaluation Kit - EK-TM4C123GXL](https://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C123GXL). The main microcontroller on the development kit is ARM Cortex-M4F 32-bit produced by Texas Instruments. Moreover, there is on-board Debugger/Programmer (Stellaris ICDI) that enable user quickly flashes and debugs easily.

Additionally, during testing và debugging, I also use Logic Analyzer to measure and capture the signal of microcontroller input/output pins.

## Software
[Keil C](https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/arm.htm) is an IDE developed by ARM company. It is a very powerful tool supports software engineer to compose, edit, compile, flash code and debug. Especially, with non-comercial version, I think it fully supports all your needs to study and research.

To visualize the measured signals of microcontroller pins from Logic Analyzer and easy to analyze the logs, [Logic 2](https://www.saleae.com/pages/downloads) tool is one of the suitale choice.
