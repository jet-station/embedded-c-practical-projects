# STM32F103C6 Blinky Demo Project

🎯 This demo project introduces the basic structure of an embedded C program using the STM32F103C6 microcontroller. The main objective is to demonstrate how to configure and control the on-board LED (connected to pin PC13) by toggling it at regular intervals.

📑 The project covers essential elements of embedded C programming, including hardware initialization, main application loop, and simple delay mechanisms. It serves as a starting point for beginners to understand how to interact with microcontroller peripherals and build more complex applications.

🔑 Key features:
- STM32F103C6 microcontroller
- On-board LED blinking (PC13)
- Simple and clear embedded C code structure

🔧 I use STM32CubeMX for hardware configuration and initialization, and Keil uVision IDE for writing, building, and debugging the embedded C code.
